In this experiment, you will validate how well a given project leverages
Develocity's remote build caching functionality when running the build from two
different CI agents. A build is considered fully cacheable if it can be invoked
twice in a row with build caching enabled and, during the second invocation, all
cacheable goals avoid performing any work because:

  * The goals' inputs have not changed since their last invocation and
  * The goals' outputs are present in the remote build cache and
  * No cacheable goals were excluded from build caching to ensure correctness

The experiment will reveal goals with volatile inputs, for example goals that
contain a timestamp in one of their inputs. It will also reveal goals that
produce non-deterministic outputs consumed by cacheable goals downstream, for
example goals generating code with non-deterministic method ordering or goals
producing artifacts that include timestamps.

The experiment will assist you to first identify those goals whose outputs are
not taken from the remote build cache due to changed inputs or to ensure
correctness of the build, to then make an informed decision which of those goals
are worth improving to make your build faster, to then investigate why they are
not taken from the remote build cache, and to finally fix them once you
understand the root cause.

The experiment needs to be run in your CI environment. It logically consists of
the following steps:

  1. Enable only remote build caching and use an empty remote build cache
  2. On a given CI agent, run a typical CI configuration from a fresh checkout
  3. On another CI agent, run the same CI configuration with the same commit id from a fresh checkout
  4. Determine which cacheable goals are still executed in the second run and why
  5. Assess which of the executed, cacheable goals are worth improving
  6. Fix identified goals

The script you have invoked does not automate the execution of step 1, step 2,
and step 3. You will need to complete these steps manually. Build scans support
your investigation in step 4 and step 5.

After improving the build to make it better leverage the remote build cache,
you can push your changes and run the experiment again. This creates a cycle
of run → measure → improve → run.

${HEADER_COLOR}Run first build on CI agent${RESTORE}

You can now trigger the first build on one of your CI agents. The invoked CI
configuration should be a configuration that is typically triggered when
building the project as part of your pipeline during daily development.

Make sure the CI configuration uses the proper branch and performs a fresh
checkout to avoid any build artifacts lingering around from a previous build
that could influence the experiment.

Also, make sure the CI configuration builds the project with Predictive Test
Selection (PTS) disabled, as test results will not be stored in the build cache
when only a subset of tests are selected for execution. PTS can be globally
disabled using the '-Dpts.enabled=false' system property.

Once the build completes, make a note of the commit id that was used, and enter
the URL of the build scan produced by the build.

Now that the first build has finished successfully, the second build can be

commit id as was used by the first build.

Make sure the CI configuration uses the proper branch and commit id and performs
a fresh checkout to avoid any build artifacts lingering around from a previous
build that could influence the experiment.

Once the build completes, enter the URL of the build scan produced by the build.

${HEADER_COLOR}Fetch build scan data${RESTORE}

Now that the second build has finished successfully, some of the build scan
data will be fetched from the two provided build scans to assist you in your
investigation.

The build scan data will be fetched via the Develocity API, as explained earlier
in the preparations section of this experiment.

Some of the fetched build scan data is expected to be present as custom values.
By default, this experiment assumes that these custom values have been created
by the Common Custom User Data Maven extension. If you are not using that
extension but your build still captures the same data under different custom
value names, you can provide a mapping file so that the required data can be
extracted from your build scans. An example mapping file named 'mapping.example'
can be found at the same location as the script.

At this point, you are ready to measure in Develocity how well your build
leverages Gradle’s remote build cache for the set of Gradle goals invoked from
two different CI agents.

The ‘Summary‘ section below captures the configuration of the experiment and the
two build scans that were published as part of running the experiment. The build
scan of the second build is particularly interesting since this is where you can
inspect what goals were not leveraging the remote build cache.

The ‘Performance Characteristics’ section below reveals the realized and
potential savings from build caching. All cacheable goals' outputs need to be
taken from the build cache in the second build for the build to be fully
cacheable.

The ‘Investigation Quick Links’ section below allows quick navigation to the
most relevant views in build scans to investigate what goals were avoided due to
remote build caching and what goals executed in the second build, which of those
goals had the biggest impact on build performance, and what caused those goals
to not be taken from the remote build cache.
