${HEADER_COLOR}Preparation ${preparation_step}- Purge remote build cache${RESTORE}

It is important to use an empty remote build cache and to avoid that other
builds write to the same remote build cache while this experiment is running.
Ensuring that these preconditions are met will maximize the reproducibility
and reliability of the experiment. Two different ways to meet these conditions
are described below.

a) If none of your builds are yet writing to the remote build cache besides
the builds of this experiment, purge the remote build cache that your build
is configured to connect to. You can purge the remote build cache by navigating
in the browser to the 'Build Cache' admin section from the user menu of your
Gradle Enterprise UI, selecting the build cache node the build is pointing to,
and then clicking the 'Purge cache' button.

b) If you are not in a position to purge the remote build cache, you can connect
to a unique shard of the remote build cache each time you run this experiment.
A shard is accessed via an identifier that is appended to the path of the remote
build cache URL, for example https://ge.example.com/cache/exp4-2021-Dec31-take1/
which encodes the experiment type, the current date, and a counter that needs
to be increased every time the experiment is rerun. Using such an encoding
schema ensures that for each run of the experiment an empty remote build cache
will be used. You need to push the changes to the path of the remote build cache
URL every time before you run the experiment.

Some build scan data will be fetched from the invoked builds via the Gradle
Enterprise API. It is not strictly necessary that you have permission to
call the Gradle Enterprise API while doing this experiment, but the summary
provided at the end of the experiment will be more comprehensive if the build
scan data is accessible. Details on how to check your access permissions and
how to provide the necessary API credentials when running the experiment are
available from the documentation of the build validation scripts.

The experiment will run using a fresh checkout of a given project stored in
Git. The fresh checkout ensures reproducibility of the experiment across
machines and users since no local changes and commits will be accidentally
included in the validation process.

Optionally, the project can be validated and optimized on an existing
branch and only merged back to the main line once all improvements are
completed.

The build will be invoked from the project’s root directory or from a given
